# City Street Networks ðŸš‹

This is a repository I made dedicated to my exploration of the Python package OSMnx.

OSMnx is created by [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/) to retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks from OpenStreetMap. Users can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, and network routing.

To learn how to use this, take a look at this [article](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/)!
